      <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter Twenty-three</h1><p><html><head></head><body>[68850] Frederik</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Low Vas Orbit</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>It took almost three days for the Delightful Death to reach low Vas orbit. Three marathon days stuck in the storm cellar with <em>Ninya Blanca</em> and her crew. And there was still no sign that <em>Ninya Blanca</em> even suspected Vis was lying about the aliens being in control of the Grayson spacecraft’s transponder, from which they could take over the main engines. Instead, <em>Ninya Blanca</em> had sent even more of her surviving crew into a meat grinder. The tempo of senseless violence aboard the Delightful Death increased.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>In description, their treatment was approximately humane. Frederik, Io, and Vis received minimal rations of food and water. Grayson would escort them to the propcan-style water closet to use three times every twenty-four hours. Yet, the tension in that storm cellar was its own form of anguish. They were at the complete mercy of a group of people who seemed to give very little value to any living thing in the universe—not even their own lives seemed to be a priority.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Frederik’s plan, however, fell into place. Omolara had stayed out of sight with her Shade as she prepared to breach the storm cellar. Betty Blue was preparing the propcan. And when they were close enough to Vas, they would get themselves and the prototype to the propcan and then to safety—all the seals and controls of Delightful Death locked by Vis as they left. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Frederik, Io, and Vis were making the final touches to the plan. Vis would tumble the spacecraft once it was on orbit over Vas. It would be unexpected and knock the guards off balance, or at least distract them long enough, so one of the three of them could secure the closed time-like curve computer. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>A well-timed reversal of Delightful Death’s tumble and the three of them might keep Grayson Services Group out-of-balance as Omolara helped them get to the docking bay. High risk, but they all thought it was their best shot at securing their lives, and the prototype.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>They ran through the plan one more time on their EAR chat, going through every conceivable detail, but Frederik couldn’t focus. He was sweating. His heart was pounding. It was easy to hide in the overall tension of the storm cellar, but he was certain at any moment <em>Ninya Blanca</em> would catch on to what they had done. They would spring their plan into action, and it would turn out not to be a surprise at all.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>[Vis]: <em>Point of no return is here.</em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body><em>Everyone ready?</em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>[Io]: <em>Now or never.</em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>[Frederik]: <em>Ugh. </em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>[Io]: <em>You can’t get cold feet, F.</em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body><em>This is mostly your idea!</em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>There was no sign Grayson had caught on to their plans. There was no more thrust from gravity pressing Frederik into his acceleration flat. The surrounding guards had not yet fully secured themselves with gecko grip. It was now or never.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>[Frederik]: <em>Oke oke, wi gah make tsow gahdah.</em><em><sup class="footnote">[148]<span class="footnote-tooltip">[Di Lingua]: Let’s fucking go. ↑</span></sup></em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>[Frederik]: <em>Go!</em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Vis began the wild tumble. Unseen, unfelt, reaction control jets across Delightful Death were bursting into life. Full thrust, with a pattern to maximize torque, even using the main engine to add to the tumble. Frederik was already in the air, alongside Io, flying toward the prototype CTCC.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Grayson was unprepared. Bodies were already lurching, hitting the floor or ceiling. Some seemed to float in midair as the center of rotation was in the middle of the storm cellar. <em>Click click. </em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>He was on the ceiling. Io was across the prototype from him. Vis gripped on the floor underneath. Frederik disconnected his side of the CTCC, pulling out connectors in the order directed by flashes on his EAR.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Loud warning alarms signaled the hatch to the storm cellar was opening. There was a gap of light from outside. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Got it!” Io said.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Io shot toward the exit with the prototype, then he shoved off to follow. Vis was already at the opening storm cellar hatch. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body><em>Pop</em>. Omolara used the exoskeletal strength of her Shade, bursting open the bottom flap of the exit hatch. Frederik was a meter behind when Io and Vis slipped through the opening like eels. He ignored the shouts and chaos behind him.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Less than two seconds after the tumble started, he was at the hatch. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Get clear!” Omolara’s disembodied voice ordered.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Out of instinct, he grabbed a microgravity handhold, torqued himself out of the way. <em>Pop pop pop pop. </em>Supersonic rounds zipped past him, making wet metal slapping noises as they struck Grayson soldiers.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>He turned just in time to see a black blur lunge at him. He was far too slow. <em>Ninya Blanca</em> smashed into him at full speed. His fingers were burning with pain as her boot ground his hand into the handle he was holding. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body><em>Pop. Ping</em>. Omolara fired at <em>Ninya Blanca</em>. There was an explosion on the ceiling, missing <em>Ninya Blanca</em>’s hand by millimeters. Sparks ricocheted. Frederik flinched and brought his left fist up to his face. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body><em>Bam. </em>His head rang like it had exploded from the inside. Then pain from the hard metal boot smashing into his left eye. Colors sparked across his EAR display from concussive force. It felt like someone had split open his head along his eye socket. His body reverberated like a rung bell.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>The reverse tumble started, throwing everyone besides <em>Ninya Blanca</em> off balance. Frederik’s situation had not fully registered, only the pain had. An arm in a strong, armored biosuit wrapped around his throat. A machine pistol braced against his shoulder. <em>Ninya Blanca</em> forced him in front of her. She was gecko gripped securely to the ceiling. Less than three seconds since their plan had begun, and it was already in shambles.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body><em>Brzzt. </em>Frederik lost all hearing from his right ear, replaced by a dull ringing buzz, as red tracer rounds sprouted out from <em>Ninya Blanca</em>’s weapon just centimeters from his head. Thumping from the weapon shook him through his shoulder. The occasional <em>whomp </em>as a hypersonic round collided with metal rattled his blood.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Blue tracers shot back. Jets of sparks bounced around like deadly firebugs, filling the storm cellar. Bubbles of blood and thick fogs of metallic dust quickly filled the air. Debris glowed and flickered in the continued crossfire. <em>Ninya Blanca</em> cut a red wave of death with a back-and-forth shake of her weapon, peppering the thick storm cellar hatch with dozens of fist-sized craters.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Ten seconds since the first tumble. Frederik gasped for breath, his only unwounded hand punching uselessly at <em>Ninya Blanca</em>’s armored forearm.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Stop!” she screamed at him in his good ear.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>He struggled more. Red hot heat touched his ear from the barrel of <em>Ninya Blanca</em>’s gun. He screamed, but it sounded muffled and far away. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“What are you even fighting for, huh? You don’t even know,” <em>Ninya Blanca</em> shouted, though it was barely audible to him. “At least I am fighting for something besides animal instinct. I fight for that pale blue dot. I fight for all terrestrial life.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“<em>Arte steh gapjil!</em>”<sup class="footnote">[149]<span class="footnote-tooltip">[Di Lingua]: Earther ignorance. ↑</span></sup> he said as he tried to wiggle free from her stranglehold.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Everyone who matters is an Earther,” she said with such viciousness bubbles of spit flew into the air, then she lifted the hot barrel of her weapon and threatened to press it against Frederik’s other ear. “Play your role, <em>astroplaag</em>, be a good human shield for me!”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>There was an unbearable heat next to his ear. He flinched. Being burned was a terrible pain. His hands fell limp.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“<em>Oke.</em>”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Good,” <em>Ninya Blanca</em> cooed.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>It was then the third pre-program tumble began. Both he and <em>Ninya Blanca</em> lurched toward the devastated hatch.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“<em>Oof,” </em>he gasped as his chest slammed into the edge of the hatch’s remains.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>His legs dangled out into the hall. He tried to push away, roll off, get to the hallway and away from <em>Ninya Blanca</em>. Recover and return to the plan. Intense pressure in his left shoulder turned into stabbing pain as claws sliced through his shoulder blade. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>He screamed again. More red streaks of tracers shot out from <em>Ninya Blanca</em>’s weapon, reached out to lick the hallway’s metal walls, first up the winding path then down it. Another back-and-forth sweep. Blindly seeking to strike out at the Shade.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Sharp metal debris and twisted ribbons of the bulkhead rained down the hallway, bouncing down from the tumble’s artificial gravity. Down was toward the docking bay. If only he slipped free, maybe he would roll his way to safety.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>There was the sucking wind of decompression, but he watched as self-assembling patch seals oozed out of burst pipes along the spiraling hallway. Smoke spiraled down the hallway like corkscrews as the emergency self-sealant solidified and welded itself to bulkhead material. He winced his good eye shut and coughed on the hot metallic-tasting dust. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Frederik’s left eye closed from the swelling and his right ear throbbed, accompanied by a high-pitched squeal that filled his hearing, but he was gradually regaining full hearing in his left ear. Blood was dripping out of his shoulder.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“You’re rusty Shade,” <em>Ninya Blanca</em> taunted with a shout out into the hallway as she slid another magazine into her machine pistol with a <em>clack</em>.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body><em>Ninya Blanca</em> pulled her claws out of his shoulder, wrapped that arm around his neck, and held her machine pistol millimeters above his temple. He was her human shield. She shoved off the ledge of the storm cellar and slid down the hallway. When she wanted him to go somewhere, she simply kneed him in the back and torqued him around with the arm around his neck.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>With the tumble, the spacecraft experienced a definite up and down—a simulated gravity—despite not being designed for it. The designers had anticipated it would be under thrust or in microgravity only, at least if the hallways were in use. During combat, they expected the storm cellar to tumble and spin, so they made it robust. However, they did not design the Delightful Death to sustain this long of a tumble, and everything in either direction from the center of the spin, the storm cellar, was both upside down and in the spin-down direction.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Every few meters she would knee him in the back, tell him to hurry forward. Through the twisting, apocalyptic, upside-down hallways. Frederik thought he could hear the hiss of escaping air, or the creak as one of the alien forms moved around in one room along the spiraling path. Along the way, he saw no sign of Io, or Vis, or Omolara. No trail to follow. Just <em>Ninya Blanca</em> blindly pushing him ahead toward the docking bay, blood dripping from his eyebrow.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>[Frederik]: <em>She’s got me.</em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body><em>We’re heading to the docking bay.</em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body><em>We’re on deck twenty-three now.</em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body><em>Just two more.</em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>[Omolara]: <em>Let her take you to the docking bay. </em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body><em>We have a plan.</em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body><em>Trust me.</em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>He had little choice. He wondered why Omolara couldn’t flank <em>Ninya Blanca</em>, especially with her Shade. But there had been a lot of weapons fire. Perhaps she had taken a hit. Either way, he trusted her enough to go where <em>Ninya Blanca</em> pushed him. She seemed dead set on getting to the docking bay, and Frederik looked at it like a mad, desperate, attempt to escape Delightful Death, and less like she was following Omolara’s invisible trail.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Limping along the spiral slope of the hallways, crunching on the ceiling lights that were not designed to take a significant force of a human body under spin acceleration, it only took a minute to reach the docking bay. Each step forward was a step further from the center of rotation in the storm cellar, which meant more apparent weight. Covered in sweat and panting, Frederik reached the large docking bay hatch as <em>Ninya Blanca</em>’s hostage. His body seemed as dense as lead in the higher than standard spin-gravity.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“You’re going through first,” <em>Ninya Blanca</em> said in a near-whisper into his good ear. “Hey!” She yelled out into the emptiness of the docking bay’s open hatch. “If you try anything, Shade, just know I have set our remaining nuclear howitzers on a timer. If I die, I will take you all with me. You hear that?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Is that true?” he asked.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Shut the fuck up.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>She hesitated a few moments, took a deep breath, and then loosened the arm around Frederik’s neck. Sharp claws grabbed at the scruff of his neck, painfully, and then she kneed him forward through the entrance. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Look inside for me,” she said as a demonic Oni mask slid out from the collar of her obsidian black armor, swallowing her face.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>[Omolara]: <em>Look left.</em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body><em>	Slowly.</em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>He turned his head. There was a familiar gecko grip holster. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>[Omolara]: <em>We’re going to shake the spacecraft in a second. </em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body><em>Fall forward. </em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body><em>Grab the gun. </em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body><em>When she pulls you back to her, aim and squeeze the trigger.</em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body><em>Safety is off, and it’s loaded.</em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body><em>Don’t kill her, just distract her.</em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Frederik looked down into the docking bay. The space was voluminous, open, and sideways. To his left and right was the nominal floor and ceiling in microgravity. Above and below him was a vast expanse of the floor, going maybe ten meters above, and ten meters below. There were three propcans, held in place with over-engineered grapple arms near the large double membraned airlock flaps. If he jumped, he would fall. Below him there were only piles of junk and empty biosuits. That was the propcan they had planned to use. It was near the top of the deck, axial-wise, but under spin that meant it was like falling. He gulped, stricken by an unexpected acrophobia.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>[Frederik]: <em>The gravity won’t kill me?</em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>[Omolara]: <em>No.</em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body><em>Look, trust me, please?</em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>[Frederik]: <em>Fine</em>.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body><em>Ninya Blanca</em> was vulnerable. Her gun and attention were elsewhere. She did not see his left hand as he dangled into the docking bay.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>[Omolara]: <em>Now!</em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>The spacecraft shook. Frederik fell forward. His left hand gripped the pistol. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>There was a stabbing pain in his neck as <em>Ninya Blanca</em> flexed her sharp glove claws and pulled him back toward the ledge of the hatchway like a mother cat carrying its kittens. He slid the pistol free with the force of <em>Ninya Blanca</em>’s pull, quickly bringing it close and low to his body, hoping she would not see it.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Just then, there was a commotion as equipment fell down the hallway behind him. <em>Ninya Blanca</em> turned, her grip on his neck loosened. She pointed her machine pistol at the source of the noise. Frederik turned. She exposed her flank to him. Frederik was right in her blind spot, still framed in the docking bay hatchway.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>He gritted his teeth, turned, aimed at the gap in the joint armor at her elbow, and fired.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body><em>Pop</em>. Her armor blossomed in a red flash at the elbow. <em>Ninya Blanca</em> dropped her gun. His hand recoiled, and he tried to aim again. Her boot kicked up, knocked Frederik off balance, and he fell into the docking bay. It was now less than standard gravity, and he fell slowly in a twisted, curved trajectory resulting from a steep spin gradient, but he landed safely in a pile of softer biosuits next to one of the propcans. He gasped, letting go of the breath he had not realized he had been holding.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body><em>Ninya Blanca</em>’s silhouette loomed in the hatchway above him. A weapon pointing in his general direction, held in her unwounded left arm. A symphony of bangs surrounded him as shots from all over the docking bay, not hypersonic boom snaps, rang out. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body><em>Ninya Blanca</em>’s body spasmed in time to the beat of the gunfire. Showers of sparks, then blood. Her shoulder, her ribcage, then a vicious gouge in the Oni mask façade, a spray of crimson. She fell to her knees, then back into the hallway away from the ledge.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Hands grabbed his shoulders, pulled him away and into a propcan.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“We got you, <em>Eff</em>,” Io said with a grunt.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>With the aid of Io, he scrambled to his feet and strapped himself into the propcan next to Vis and her prototype. A few moments later, Omolara in her vantablack lizard armor appeared in the hatch, pull it closed, and clambered into the pilot’s seat. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Is she dead?” Betty Blue asked, grimly.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Didn’t check,” Omolara said. “Instead, dropped flashbangs right on top of her.” <br>	“What about the nuclear howitzers?” Frederik asked.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“I took care of them earlier.” Omolara said.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>They ran through the last of the pre-flight check. A few moments later, his ears popped. There was a roar of wind as the docking bay depressurized, then a <em>click pop </em>and kick of acceleration as the propcan exited the docking bay and they burned to freedom.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>***</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“We’re cleared to land,” Vis announced a few hours later.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>The acceleration pressed Frederik’s body into the flat in the propcan. Vis had given it the handle: <em>Baff Up En Baze</em>. A nice, inconspicuous, <em>Di Lingua </em>name to hide the fact they had just left a spacecraft that had destroyed aliens with a nuclear thermal lance, went to Vas, spun itself around in unhealthy ways like a drunk tumbling pigeon, and then had gone completely radio silent. Fortunately, the propcan had enough power in the fuel cells for Vis to smooth things out using her computer. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>She told the authorities that this was all just a drill. A continuation of the special Cooperative Defense operation Grayson had already fabricated. It was a thin cover, but the valid seals Vis produced erased skepticism, despite the ridiculousness of the story they had woven.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>There were no windows on this propcan, only ink displays showing exterior views. A dusty white Vas loomed as desolate as the deep deserts of Ahtash. Its ground covered in bumps that glittered in the bright Ya Ke starlight, broken only by large jet-black solar power stations. It evoked a deep sense of loneliness in its apparent desolation.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Why does anyone live here?” Betty Blue asked from the flat next to Frederik.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Frederik sighed, looking down at his aching hand, jammed into a biosuit glove. “People need food even in space. You could feed all of Ya Ke just through the farms of <em>Domot Get Grond Dey </em>and the domes of Vas.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Io gave him a nudge, then looked at Betty Blue. “Where are you from, Blue?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Sipapu.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Aren’t you an Upper?” Frederik asked.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>She nodded. “Yes. From the special political zone. Where are you from, Io?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Chiron. Victory City.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“You’re far from home.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Io smiled crookedly. “Y<em>e</em>, the homeworlders who leave do a thorough job of it.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Technically, not as far from home as us,” Omolara said as she waved toward Vis.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Only by a tenth of a light-year,” Io said. “If we’re going to be technical about it.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“My home is wherever Chaeyoung is,” Vis said as she focused on an unseen EAR window. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Omolara and Betty Blue looked ashamed by what Vis had said, each looking down at their boots. Frederik tilted his head, wondering what they had to feel guilty about. Io tapped his shoulder to grab his attention.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“<em>Ye</em>, <em>Eff</em>, but food aside—why would anyone come here? Unless they were desperate.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>He laughed. “Being desperate is why we’re here, Io.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Exactly! So why is it the second most populous moon of Jin?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“People enjoy it when things are quiet and predictable. Simple as that.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>***</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Their propcan landed with a series of loud clicks, the sound of a rushing river of liquid, and a kick in the back from hard acceleration. Dust billowed up around the ink display windows, obscuring the view. They touched down with a gentle <em>thump</em>.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Outside was the dusty yellow, lifeless expanse, the ever-present Jin in the night sky, and the stretch of farm domes, radiators, and solar panels. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Helmets on,” Omolara said.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Here, let me,” Io said as she rushed to help Frederik.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Frederik winced at the pain in his crushed hand, and smiled weakly. “Thanks.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>With Io’s help, he stumbled out into the dusty void of Vas. His faceplate polarized to block out the bright Ya Ke starlight. They were on a dusty stone landing tarmac at one of the largest hospitals on Vas.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>It was deceptively simple looking. Constructed from material the same yellow-gray dust that covered everything on Vas, with silver-mirrored coating on spinel ceramic windows to filter most of the Ya Ke daylight. It was barely larger than the plentiful farming domes, cooling structures, or solar panel columns built all around it, but it was the only flat and rectangular structure across the entire horizon. There were no seal checks at airlocks and people wandered in and out of the airlock’s vestibule, heading to or from various dust covered rovers.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Are we sure this is safe?” Frederik asked over their radio, with a slight slur from his healing tongue.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“With our new seals,” Vis said, pointing to her left wrist. “And our new identities, we’re as good as ghosts.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“You need to see a doctor, <em>Eff</em>,” Io said stoically, but Frederik could hear a slight inflection of concern beneath.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“If they know to look for someone with my injuries, they’ll—”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>There was a bright flash in the sky. Everyone besides Omolara gasped. There in the black pool void sky of Vas’s daylight, there was a large, artificial nebula. Two cones of gas escaping from a common center. It was a nuclear howitzer detonation.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“I don’t think we need to worry about anyone from the Delightful Death coming after us,” Omolara said in a detached and cold tone that made Frederik shiver.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>He glared at Omolara’s vantablack form, but he did not openly object. He merely shrugged it off with the others and continued toward the hospital.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>***</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Frederik was lying in a medical flat in a large, open-floor hospital space. Io was sitting in a chair next to him. The medical staff had already wrapped Frederik’s hand in medical weaves, connected his arm to a drip-line and an auto-doc, placed a patch over his left eye, and dressed him in a hospital gown.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>The hospital space was a massive rectangular room, divided by neat rows of medical flats. Each row was about six flats long and two flats wide, with each flat facing into the hall.  There was a dividing wall separating back-to-back flats, with rubber grating between the rows and underneath the flats, translucent sheeting connected to piping that ran along the tall ceiling to separate each area into a semi-private cubicle. In front of Frederik, there was a walking space, and across that walking space, there was a row of medical flats facing him.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Yellow gray Vasian dust packed with a sealant finish was used to create a concrete analog for the floor under the mats. Along the perimeter of the room were equipment lockers, medical test benches, chairs to sit in, and other quotidian items for any large medical facility.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Out of the nearly hundred medical flats in the room, Frederik had seen less than five blurry figures visible behind the curtains. Only the barest fraction of the hospital’s capacity was being used. The hospital could care for a significant portion of the Vasian population, but in regular situations, it only used a small fraction of that capacity. Frederik wondered what might cause stress on medical infrastructure that they would plan for such large volumes of wounded, and he shuddered remembering some of his own ordeal.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Omolara was standing only a handful of rows down, talking to Vis outside Betty Blue’s cubicle. Io waved, Vis smiled, but Omolara gave a curt nod and continued her conversation.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Think she is responsible for that explosion? That last one we saw?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Absolutely,” Io replied so immediately Frederik had barely finished asking his question. “She rigged a nuclear lance to detonate once we were clear and on the ground.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>When he saw Omolara, a frown appeared on his face. His heart filled with an intense desire to hate her and everyone from the Solar system for unilaterally making such a large decision—after all, the aliens left onboard had done nothing to Frederik directly, but Omolara had killed them alongside any Grayson Services Group survivors. He wanted to hate the Uppers for all the messiness of this job and blame them for the very existence of Grayson Services Group. But he couldn’t help feeling that he was forcing the anger, and as soon as he noticed it, the feelings would fade away, leaving him merely unsettled. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Omolara was a <em>stellah steh</em>. She was from a culture that had the same roots as his. <em>Stellah steh </em>was born from Mars. Martians built and grew all the Upper habitats. Even if he thought all the worst parts of United Planets culture came from Earth—the <em>Arte steh</em>—that was the ultimate source of all cultures. Zealots and violent extremists like Grayson Services Group weren’t so much a unique <em>Arte myawn </em>problem, but a latent possibility everywhere, in all people. A shadow that lurked, even in the beautiful and peaceful spaces of the <em>Domot Get Grond Dey</em>.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Vis helped me send a message to Diya,” Io said.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Frederik pulled out of his introspective gloom. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“How is she?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“She’s fine, but worried. I told her to wait for us at Azure Arcbeam, back on Skarda. Don’t expect it to take more than a week to get you out and make the trip.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>He nodded. “If they discharge me today, we can be there within four days if we burn hard.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“And… after that? After we get you back to Diya?” </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>She reached out and rested her hand on his knee. Frederik placed his good hand over hers and squeezed. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“I’m not sure.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>She flicked an EAR window over at him. “Maybe this message from Taliya will help you decide.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“She’s giving us one hundred and forty thousand <em>swawn</em>? And locked Kirk out of his cut?” </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Io leaned back in her chair and laughed. “You ended up getting a lot more than just triple pay, <em>Eff</em>.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“<em>Di plenti treasure.</em>”<sup class="footnote">[150]<span class="footnote-tooltip">[Di Lingua]: The universe provides. ↑</span></sup> Frederik said sarcastically. “And I won’t lie. Seeing Kirk’s reputation burned from the root was a pleasant surprise. Thank you, Io.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“I was just the messenger,” Io blushed and smiled.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Any other surprises for me?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Just one more,” she pulled his family’s Martian shawl out and draped it over his shoulders.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“<em>Nawa oh!</em><em><sup class="footnote">[151]<span class="footnote-tooltip">[Di Lingua]: Woah! ↑</span></sup> </em>How did you find this?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>She nodded toward Betty Blue’s blurry silhouette behind one of the spinel ceramic curtains. “She found it in the docking bay. Held on to it, forgot about it until today.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Frederik yawned, warm and tired beneath the shawl. “Can you thank her for me? I am getting tired.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Of course,” she gave Frederik a crooked smile. “So, what’s next? You have enough Tonn to do anything you want.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Maybe we could settle down on Skarda…” he sighed. “But, <em>yu gah sabi</em>, maybe we could travel.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“To Celosia?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Just for a week,” Frederik chuckled. “I think I would get bored after any more than that. But maybe we leave Ya Ke entirely? I want to see what life is like around other stars.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“And what about stability? Settling down?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>He put his good hand over hers. “That would be good for me, and Diya—”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“And me.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“You would settle down? Become a farmer?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Io laughed. “I think we’ve had enough adventure for a lifetime. It’s time for me to find a home.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“My home is with Diya…and you. If we are together, we will have stability,” Frederik sighed contentedly and leaned back in his medical flat, closing his eyes, suddenly exhausted. “But I am not sure Ya Ke has to be a part of that anymore.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Io kissed his forehead lightly as he drifted off to sleep.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body><a id="_jqi1s04vd7vy"></a><a id="_vu19wppwrm7u"></a><a id="_Toc157439164"></a><a id="_Toc165819965"></a><strong>Chapter Twenty-four</strong></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>[68833] Chaeyoung</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Tritonis Prime</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Chaeyoung sat in the shower, looking at her bruised and battered body. There was plentiful water on Tritonis Prime, but not enough gravity—and it was showing on her body. She was gaunt, bruised, swollen, but at least she was warm. She turned off the water, stood up, and looked at herself in the mirror.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“And what do the events of Tritonis Prime tell us about our place in the universe?” she said to herself in a mocking, scientific tone. “Now that we have found not just a truly exobiological system—astrobiology without a terrestrial or even solar origin—but also an unambiguously terrifying techno signature?” she emphasized the question like it was something truly exciting. “Well, Dr. No. I’d say we’re truly fucked.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>She laughed, but it was a forced laugh that did little but sour her mood. “<em>Pol tsow zloy-zloy</em>.”<sup class="footnote">[152]<span class="footnote-tooltip">[Di Lingua]: Shit fucking madness. ↑</span></sup> </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>While muttering to herself, she picked up an ostentatious cloth towel from Earth that she had salvaged from the hab stowage to dry herself off, and then she put on a biosuit borrowed from Murphy. Carefully pulling it over her body, she made sure not to let the thick metal vee shapes behind and in front of the neck O-ring hit her. Then, with a flick of her wrist, she tightened the counter-pressure straps and wriggled her fingers and toes until the gloves and boots were comfortable. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>She looked down at the black, blue, and Titan haze triangular pattern of the fatigue-style outer layer. It was practical, and she didn’t look so bad in a uniform, she thought as she pulled her hair into a messy chignon. But the real reason she kept wearing it was the spinel ceramic helmet that could telescope out at a moment’s notice—it gave her a sense of control over her environment.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Chaeyoung had made the most of her improved treatment over the last few days, but it hardly made a difference. Because she was alone in her hab, nightmares and sorrows constantly haunted her. Because of her complete access to EAR interfaces, she discovered the grim fact that no one she knew was within twenty light years, and that she wouldn’t have been able to send them a message even if they were in Sipapu, as she lacked a seal. She had full freedom of movement, but there wasn’t anywhere to go to on Tritonis Prime, except the implosion craters left behind from the destroyed mines and alien structures beneath the ice. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>She thought of herself, and all the others who played a vital role in destroying the horrors in the core lab, as prisoners. They left all of them on the ice moon surface under quarantine protocols. Did it matter much that they only had a few days left before the newly arrived diplomatic spacecraft would pick them up and take her to Ya Ke? Chaeyoung couldn’t get herself to really believe in a tomorrow. No, she was absolutely a prisoner.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>She rubbed her left wrist, trying to remember what it was even like wearing a seal bracelet every day. There was still a lot she could access without a seal, but she always returned to the same routine instead. She pulled open the recording of the strange broadcast from the xenolith, out to who knows where, and opened a bottle of <em>soja </em>she had scavenged from one of the Grayson stowage lockers. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>She fished out the comically large bottle of Titanian <em>soja </em>from the bottom drawer.  Yesterday, she had thrown it in there and declared, “I am done with you.”  With a shake of the <em>soja </em>bottle and a flick of her hand, she sat on the floor of the small kitchen area and listened to the recording of the alien throat singing on the overhead speakers on a loop.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Warbling, distorted, human voices filled the hab. She took a swig of <em>soja</em>, letting the burning flavors wash around her mouth before she swallowed and let out a satisfied sigh. She looked at the bottle, considered taking another swig, but put it on the counter above her instead. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Without shutting off the recording of the alien transmission, she opened an EAR window and watched a day-old stream discussing an ongoing investigation into Grayson Services Group activities in the Old Towne Autonomous Zone on Olentsi. The authorities shuttered Grayson’s local Olentsi headquarters and there had been, allegedly, several firefights. It was not a new story, almost a full year old, but more scandalous details were coming out every day, like the fact it had been a joint operation between Cooperative Defense and the United Planets. Chaeyoung was pretty sure she knew some of the people that had been involved in the fighting and even suspected she was now living as a prisoner among some of them.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Chaeyoung! Little Bird!? Open up.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Murphy’s shouts startled her.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“<em>Comot</em>, Little Bird! <em>Palli-palli!</em>”<sup class="footnote">[153]<span class="footnote-tooltip">[Di Lingua]: Quickly quickly. ↑</span></sup> Murphy said impatiently over the airlock intercom.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Chaeyoung stumbled over, wobbly from <em>soja </em>on an empty stomach and exhaustion. With a heavy press of her fist against the physical comms button, she leaned her face against the cool metal hatchway, her face bursting with warmth.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“What is it?” she asked.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“It’s Anya. She’s in trouble.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“I’m not a medical doctor. What do you think I can do?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Already got her stabilized, but we need an expert opinion.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“<em>Oke</em>,” Chaeyoung gulped. “I’ll be out as soon as the airlock cycles.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Just override it. Button up and open the hatch.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Are you serious?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Yes, this is serious, Little Bird. No time to waste.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Chaeyoung checked the seals on her gloves and boots, made sure the counter-pressure straps were snug, and unfolded her helmet. With a wave of her hand, the telescoping spinel ceramic plates slid out from the two vee-shaped metal emplacements behind her head and in front of her chin. The helmet covered her head like some animal snapping its jaws shut. She ran diagnostics quickly, turned down the oxygen levels, but increased the pressure, and braced her boots against the deck with gecko grip. <em>Click click</em>.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“I’m ready.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“<em>Oke,</em> stand back.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Murphy initiated a manual override of the airlock, opening the outer and inner hatches simultaneously. There was a tremendous gust of wind. The towel she had just used, piles of ink displays, her <em>soja </em>bottle, and an assortment of abandoned Grayson gear jolted toward the airlock. About half of the junk flew all the way out into the void, some going in long parabolic arcs as they achieved significant velocities. <em>Whoosh</em>.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Chaeyoung’s biosuit beeped at her, angry at the sudden change in pressure, warning her of an elevated heart rate and a rapid change in blood gases. She was a little lightheaded, but otherwise fine.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“This better be important,” she said.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>She knew better than to say that, but she was just irritated.  Murphy, in her Shade armor—the name for the vantablack lizard suit or its wearer, as Chaeyoung had learned—was already moving along the metal grating deck that connected the occupied Grayson habs. She followed, uncertain on her feet, and tried not to look at the depression in the center of the ring of the habs.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>She looked anyway. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Where the propcan-turned-elevator had once brought her down into the old mines, there was now a cracked depression. The destruction of the core lab, along with the alien complex and most of the surrounding mine tunnels, caused the ground to sink down like land pulled into a sinkhole. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Everything down there was now buried or destroyed. Even the elevator shaft had fallen in on itself, completely cutting off any future access to the tunnels. The resulting quake had even knocked over the large radio dish, which had fallen along the ridge. Part of the ring of Grayson’s habs had collapsed as well.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“<em>Comot</em>, Little Bird, speed it up!” Murphy urged Chaeyoung.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“<em>Oke oke.</em>”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Anya and the other Shades occupied the three habs next to Chaeyoung, five Shades to each. Anya was in the middle one. Someone, probably Murphy, had popped open the airlock of Anya’s hab, just like Chaeyoung’s hab. She avoided the piles of debris outside the exit, followed Murphy closely, and entered. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>It was the same layout as hers, which was the same as almost any inflatable hab, only in vacuum the walls and ceiling drooped down. A large double membrane emergency airlock blocked off the back quarter of the hab, draping between the wall of the water closet and the edge of one of the far bunks.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“We’ll do a rapid repress,” Murphy explained as she zipped open a flap, pressed the inner membrane forward, and made room for Chaeyoung to get in after her.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>It was snug. An emergency membrane like this was essentially an empty pocket sandwiched between the outer layer and the inner pressurized envelope. It was not all that dissimilar to the emergency vacuum bubble on the SSV Jiuhe, or the one down in the mines, but it had thicker, semi-flexible surfaces that could create a second air pocket between them. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Murphy was pressing on the large air balloon of the pressurized inner surface to make room for the two of them in the interstitial, depressurized pocket. Chaeyoung was so much shorter than the <em>stellah steh</em>, she barely had to lean over and could fit easily in the space formed under Murphy’s armpit and her outstretched arm. Chaeyoung zipped the outer membrane closed, sealed the gecko grip flap on the interior, and let Murphy know they were ready.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“<em>Oke</em>. Brace yourself.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Chaeyoung nodded, clicked her feet to the bottom of the membrane with gecko grip. <em>Click click</em>. “<em>Am gah hahdah</em>.”<sup class="footnote">[154]<span class="footnote-tooltip">[Di Lingua]: Do it. ↑</span></sup></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body><em>Whoosh</em>. Murphy refilled the empty pocket with air from the interior. More warnings flashed across Chaeyoung’s EAR from her biosuit, but no serious signs of danger, so she ignored them. Murphy zipped the inner membrane all the way open, and they stepped inside what was just the corner of a hab’s room. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>One bed space, one stowage locker, one portable life-support box from an emergency habitat system, and just about enough room for Murphy, Chaeyoung, and Kim—who was tending to Anya—to crowd around a medical flat. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Kim was in his Shade, helmet off, but was wearing a dedicated exocortex-style headset, leaning over Anya, moving controls on an ink display. Anya was in the flat, swaddled in a human shaped semi-translucent bag filled with a slurry of ice and blue fluids and connected to an external pump with a large fan and radiator fins. Rapidly emptying bags of transparent liquid sat above her head, pumping their contents through a line that was embedded directly into her carotid artery. Crab-like autos, about half the size of Chaeyoung’s palm, crawled over the bag, moving various instruments and electrodes.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“What’s the situation?” Chaeyoung asked.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“I just stabilized her, but she’s unconscious,” Kim said. “Auto-doc showed increasing body temperature, crashing blood glucose. We’re lucky Grayson’s med bay had a temperature control bivvy sack and some medical autos—not sure she would have survived her fever otherwise.” </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“And the xenoma?” Chaeyoung asked, wondering about the strange growths that had developed on Anya’s shoulder over the last several days.<br>	“As far as I can tell, reviewing our streams of what we saw down there, it’s nothing like what happened to them,” Kim said tersely. “But look yourself.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Kim handed Chaeyoung an ink display without turning his head. Notes and images of Anya’s skin condition—the xenoma—taken with various instruments in various wavelengths.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“<em>Nawa oh!</em>”<sup class="footnote">[155]<span class="footnote-tooltip">[Di Lingua]: Woah! ↑</span></sup> Chaeyoung gasped at the extent of the xenoma and comparison images.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Yesterday, it had looked like a strange purple growth. It resembled more of a bruise or a scab rather than something alien, which was not surprising considering a xenolith tendril had pierced through her Shade into her shoulder. That should leave a bruise. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Today, the growth had expanded more than exponentially, following the negative space of Anya’s <em>stellah steh </em>tattoos, avoiding inked skin but entirely circumscribed by it. As a result, the xenoma extended down to her ankles, up to her neck, across her arms, across her back, almost like someone had covered up the bare skin between the black ink lines of her tattoos with a dark purple metallic glitter. Chaeyoung also noticed a lone tendril of the alien affliction had traced a trail up into Anya’s left ear, like a bloom of purple-black fractal work spreading out from a thick trail along her left jawline.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Murphy pointed at the image. “She has a hearing aid implanted there.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“A hearing aid?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“<em>Ye</em>. To correct hearing loss from an operation gone bad on Ahtash.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Under infrared light, it was clear the growths were producing massive amounts of heat, and when viewed with micro-optics at high zoom, the growths looked like a filigree of glittering mildewy tendrils. The unsettling image worked its way down Chaeyoung’s spine like a drop of liquid nitrogen rolling off her neck. Kim was correct in that it did not look like what happened to Mimo, but it was too strange and too similar for her to find any comfort in the dissimilarities.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“<em>Pol tsow</em>.”<sup class="footnote">[156]<span class="footnote-tooltip">[Di Lingua]: Shit fuck. ↑</span></sup> </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>She cursed, and wondered if she had made a profound, irreversible, mistake when she had pushed Anya into the changed xenolith. It had been a gamble. It was unlikely, but it was possible that the modifications made to the xenolith turned it into a substance that could neutralize the self-replicating ferrofluid materials found in the unmodified xenoliths. She was furious at herself thinking anything good could have come from a xenolith.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“What? What is it?” Murphy asked.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Chaeyoung shook her head, took a step away from Anya’s flat. “I don’t know what this is—I can’t help.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Murphy crossed her arms. “J<em>uan juye</em>.<sup class="footnote">[157]<span class="footnote-tooltip">[Di Lingua]: Bullshit. ↑</span></sup> Try anyway.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Chaeyoung muttered her disagreement but looked back at the ink display, anyway. “Can you tell me the composition of the new growths?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Preliminary results are the same as the initial xenoma growth,” Kim answered without looking away from whatever it was he saw on his headset. “Dead skin cells, metallic composition nearly identical to dust from the hab—aluminum, manganese, boron filaments, a little bit of steel and gold, trace amounts of graphite. More like xenobots made from skin cells and junk than any infection I ever heard about.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“And that’s all we have?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Anything worthy of the task was down in the core lab. Everything we have here is medical, so <em>ye, </em>that’s all I can see with what we got. For the record, it all looks very different from what we found down there—it’s all very different organometallic chemistry.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“How close of a look did you get in the core lab?” Chaeyoung asked, an edge of bitterness creeping into her tone as she wondered if the Shades had already broken their promises.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“No need for skepticism,” Kim said calmly. “Our Shades have extensive optics systems, which were supplemented by my autos. There wasn’t time to get a very close look, and we didn’t have the magnetic resonance imaging the auto-doc does, but we streamed extensive spectral data almost as comprehensive as these little workers,” Kim gestured to one of the crab autos. “Nothing that would count as a true study.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“We should have taken some samples,” Murphy grumbled.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“No. I stand by that decision,” Chaeyoung said, irritated.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Look,” Kim said as he turned around to face Murphy and Chaeyoung. “What’s done is done. We’re at the limits of the auto-doc’s abilities and my cross-training as a medic.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Why am I here then?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“You might not agree, but I think you’ve made the correct calls when it mattered,” Kim shrugged with his hands. “Either way, USV <em>Neva Palava </em>has a far more comprehensive medical bay, and extensive resources to fab almost anything they don’t have. I think we should request a medical evac from that joint diplomatic team up there and figure out what’s happening to her, using their facilities.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“No!” Chaeyoung asserted. “You can’t risk taking her anywhere else—not in this condition! It’s too risky. We should request they bring that equipment down here.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“We can request that, but can’t guarantee they’ll agree,” Kim said. “Also, they have the authority to issue us orders.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“You don’t need to obey them.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“<em>Anchuan shiyong</em>,”<sup class="footnote">[158]<span class="footnote-tooltip">[Di Lingua]: Handle safely. ↑</span></sup> Murphy said in a coldly cautioning tone.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Technically,” Kim said with an exasperated sigh. “But I don’t think you’ll find a single one of us Shades down here who wouldn’t risk an outbreak if it means we save her.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Fine,” Chaeyoung said through gritted teeth. “We should at least keep her isolated, in her Shade.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Can we keep her stabilized like that?” Murphy asked Kim.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“<em>Ye</em>. Shade’s cooling garment should be enough now that she’s stable. We should continue to administer glucose through her medical ports, however.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Then it’s settled,” Murphy declared. “We’ll take her to <em>Neva Palava</em>.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>***</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Ugh. How long was I out?” Anya groaned after they got her into the Shade and depressurized the emergency air bubble entirely.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Chaeyoung almost threw herself out of her seat from the edge of the flat when Anya spoke.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Only a few hours,” Kim said.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Felt like longer,” Anya replied weakly. “What happened?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Chaeyoung made a fist with her right hand, gently tapped Anya’s shoulder plate. “We’re not sure—yet—but we’re taking you somewhere we can figure it out, <em>oke</em>?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>There was no reply.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Think she passed out again,” Kim said.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Shuttle is on its final approach,” Murphy said as she returned through the opened airlock hatches. “Can she walk?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“She was just awake,” Chaeyoung said as she grabbed both of Anya’s shoulders. “<em>Oiya!</em><em><sup class="footnote">[159]<span class="footnote-tooltip">[Spanning Worlds]: Hey! ↑</span></sup></em> Copper Wing! Get up!”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Anya roused and mumbled groggily.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Can you walk?” Chaeyoung asked.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“I think so,” she teetered onto her feet.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“<em>Nawa oh!</em>”<sup class="footnote">[160]<span class="footnote-tooltip">[Di Lingua]: Woah! ↑</span></sup> Chaeyoung said as Kim and her simultaneously reached up to stabilize Anya. “Let us help you, <em>anchuan shiyong, ye?</em>”<sup class="footnote">[161]<span class="footnote-tooltip">[Di Lingua]: Safe handling, yeah? ↑</span></sup></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Anya agreed, and Kim and Chaeyoung helped her out of the hab. They had to help hold her up in her Shade as Murphy led the way to the makeshift landing pad. It was the same path she had walked with Sato, Mimo, and Ali on the way to the hell that was the core lab. Chaeyoung felt a bewildering mix of emotions as she and Kim helped Anya walk along the path carved into the ice. Guilt, shame, triumph, fear, anxiety, hope—it all washed over her.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>In the night sky of Tritonis Prime, USV <em>Neva Palava </em>was visible<em>. </em>It was a bright, artificial star. Closer to the horizon, its shuttle—a Titan flyer—flickered and tumbled on its approach to the landing pad. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Shaped a bit like a squeezed asymmetric four-point star that was flattened in the third dimension, the angular Titan flyer craft seemed out of place in space. It was a bidirectional flying wing craft, covered in a dark gray tantalum hafnium skin laid over aerogel insulation—a dense and sturdy re-entry heat shield—along with toggleable air breathing rocket engines and an overall dense, compact, and exceedingly aerodynamic design. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>None of these features were necessary in vacuum. Users operated Titan Flyers like any propcan. The vehicle served as a single-stage-to-orbit shuttle for low-gravity worlds, but its designers built it to live up to its name: flying in Titan’s thick atmosphere.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Chaeyoung had seen them before, but never been inside one. She realized she had known people from SSV Jiuhe, now surely deceased, who would have loved to be in Chaeyoung’s position now—about to ride on a Titan flyer.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>By the time the evacuating group had reached the landing pad, the flattened shuriken-like spacecraft had landed horizontally, its ramp extended. Excited United Planets marines in armored biosuits pointed their coilguns out in a defensive posture. Murphy put her hands up, uttered the correct military protocols over the radio. The marines in armored biosuits lowered their guns, and Murphy waved Kim and Chaeyoung onboard. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Where are we going?” Anya weakly groaned as they helped her strap into one of the vertical acceleration flats.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“We’re going somewhere they can take better care of you,” Chaeyoung explained. “USV <em>Neva Palava</em>.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>***</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Chaeyoung had been on Tritonis Prime for too long. The low gravity had caused Chaeyoung’s muscles to atrophy, decreased her bone density, and exposed her to a sizable amount of galactic cosmic radiation. All of this had become apparent almost immediately upon lift-off on the Titan flyer. She passed out, woke up strapped to a medical flat, covered in instruments and with several drugs being administered.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“What…what’s happening?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Don’t worry, Dr. No, we’ll take care of you,” an unfamiliar voice reassured her before she faded out of consciousness.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>What followed was not at all what she had expected. She experienced her days filled with medical treatments, discussions about her recovery, and what they called “debriefs.” They forced her to go over every detail of everything that had happened to her, from reaching Mu Herculis to waking up onboard USV Neva Palava.<em> </em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>She met both United Planets and Spanning Worlds officials, soldiers, diplomats, and doctors. She thought she was repeating herself over and over, giving them no new information, but her body was recovering well and she was glad for that. It was grueling, and she had not heard from Murphy, Kim, or Anya. Though she repeatedly asked after them, she was always told “you’ll see them soon.” But she never did.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>The thirteenth day onboard <em>Neva Palava</em> was no different, though she was nearing the end of her physical therapy. The radiation exposure treatments had been a wild success, and her mood had significantly improved after days of intense psychotherapy. Chaeyoung was flexing her right arm, feeling the tube in her veins, feeling stronger than yesterday, when she heard someone enter the med bay with a gentle <em>click click click</em>.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body><em>“Hao fa, Dr. No?”</em><em><sup class="footnote">[162]<span class="footnote-tooltip">[Di Lingua]: Hello. ↑</span></sup> </em></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Enter.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>The privacy curtain around her medical flat opened, and one of the United Planets diplomats, Zhang-Zidane Gazala, entered, gave a polite bow, and smiled brightly at Chaeyoung.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“I was not expecting you. Are there any other special surprises on the agenda for your interrogation today?” Chaeyoung asked teasingly, though she knew she could not hide the very real resentment that lingered behind her sarcastic mask.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“I would like to talk to you about what happens after your recovery is over,” Gazala answered with a sly smile. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Chaeyoung blushed. Gazala had full lips. A dim orange pattern of stars that glimmered in the golden highlights of her cosmetics. Lavender streaks accentuated the cool purple undertones of her skin—and matched the yellow-orange of her EAR mod that was always glowing. She was tall and confident. Effortlessly striking and graceful like every <em>stellah steh</em>. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“It’s been fifty-eight days,” Chaeyoung said, looking down at her palms. “In tau,” she turned her glare back to the beautiful diplomat standing next to her medical flat. “Fifty-eight Solar days since I last saw Vis. I hope you’re here to tell me I get to see her again before that number reaches sixty.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Gazala bowed her head with a slight tilt, her smile briefly dimmed into a somber frown. “<em>Chu’eh son</em>, Dr. No.<sup class="footnote">[163]<span class="footnote-tooltip">[Di Lingua]: Sorry, Dr. No. ↑</span></sup> Unfortunately, that is not what I am here to discuss—not entirely.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Then I am not interested,” Chaeyoung said as she closed her eyes and leaned back into the medical flat. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“<em>Byanjeng bin dey</em>,”<sup class="footnote">[164]<span class="footnote-tooltip">[Di Lingua]: Of course. ↑</span></sup> Gazala sighed. “Let me drop the <em>cut</em>, then. We will bring a joint case against Grayson Services Group forward to the ICJ—the United Planets and the Spanning Worlds—and we’re willing to support you if you testify in our case.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“And what would that involve?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“We would travel to Ya Ke, you would receive a new seal, you would stay on Celosia in protective custody until the court convenes, you would provide your testimony, and then you’re free to go.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“And Vis?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“We would offer her a similar deal, yes.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Similar?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Gazala gave Chaeyoung a sad smile. “As you know, she’s from the United Planets. As part of the Jiuhe contract her stay in the Spanning Worlds was authorized for years on IBIS, but since you both have broken that contract, she is no longer in good standing with the Spanning Worlds and would have to return to United Planets space after the trial.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Broke the contract?!” Chaeyoung asked. “We were fucking kidnapped!”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Gazala shrugged with her hands. “I know, but IBIS rules are what they are—neither of us can change that.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“<em>Jaw hey juan juye dey</em>.”<sup class="footnote">[165]<span class="footnote-tooltip">[Di Lingua]: That’s bullshit. ↑</span></sup></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Yes,” she nodded while looking concerned. “It’s a terrible system. But I can’t change that now.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“And if I refuse to testify?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Unfortunately, my Spanning World counterpart has made it clear that if that were to happen, they would not issue you a Spanning Worlds seal.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“What? They can do that?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Unfortunately, yes. It’s their government, Dr. No, and your situation with Acheron Private Capital Group is very complicated and delicate. However, if that were the case, I would be happy to sponsor a petition to become a United Planets citizen.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Ugh,” she gritted her teeth and flexed her hands. “Are there no other options?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“There’s one more option. You know as well as anyone that whatever happened to Commander Chen—Anya—requires further study.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Here we go,” she mumbled as she crossed her arms. “What are you proposing?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Right now the cooperation between the United Planets and Spanning Worlds is a fragile continuation of the cooperation necessary to resolve this Grayson Services Group situation, but we are in talks to extend this into an official joint operation to deal with, how shall I put this? Emerging threats.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Ah. And what would my role be in this joint operation?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“I hope you can appreciate, Dr. No, that most of the details are only going to be shared on a need-to-know basis—and it would be improper to share such details with a private citizen—but, I can tell you that you would be at the forefront of the scientific investigation of these exobioforms.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Is that what you’re calling them? The aliens?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“<em>Prastitey?</em>”<sup class="footnote">[166]<span class="footnote-tooltip">[Di Lingua]: Excuse me? ↑</span></sup></body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Chaeyoung shook her head. “Doesn’t matter—suppose I take part in this joint operation, what do I get out of it?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“You would be our lead exobiologist, Dr. No.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“That’s it?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Well, we plan to have scientific centers in Ya Ke, Sipapu, and Sol. You would need seals for travel and for work. And, as you know, Dr. Silva would be a valuable asset in this joint operation—we’d be very keen if you could discuss the matter with her in Ya Ke. That would be very difficult to do if you were in protective custody, of course, but if you were part of the joint operation…well, then recruitment of other valuable scientific assets would be one of your duties as scientific lead.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Is Vis still in Ya Ke then?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“She should have arrived at the safe house a few days ago, proper time of course.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Let me guess, with my security clearance in the joint operation, I could speak to her, even when she is in protective custody? But if I testify, and that’s it, then they will keep us in separate custody?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“That is correct.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Chaeyoung clenched her jaw. “How long do I have to decide?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“We will <em>gidizip </em>to Ya Ke tomorrow. Once we arrive, you’ll have half a day to decide if you’re part of the joint operation or testifying. If you decide to refuse both options, we’ll shuttle you to the K-station—it will be the only place you can go without a seal.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Chaeyoung feigned a yawn. “I need rest. I’ll give you my decision when we get to Ya Ke.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Gazala nodded. “Very well. <em>Ahdioseu</em>, Dr. No.”<sup class="footnote">[167]<span class="footnote-tooltip">[Di Lingua]: Goodbye, Dr. No. ↑</span></sup> </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>She exited with a polite and deep bow.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Chaeyoung cursed under her breath when she heard the hatch close. Resentment at the bind she was in boiled up, but before she could ruminate too much, more guests entered the med bay. The hatch creaked, someone exchanged words with the doctor on duty, and Chaeyoung noticed a fuzzy shape crossing the med bay and leaving through the hatch. Two more figures entered, and her curtains parted with a <em>zip</em>.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>She relaxed when she saw her new guests. “I am glad to see you two.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Kim smiled at Chaeyoung, but Murphy looked grim. She had only seen them once outside of their Shade armor, and it was a bit of an adjustment, but they were friendly faces. Each wore an identical biosuit with working coveralls in a blue, black, and Titan haze triangular pattern, seal patches, name patches, and metallic vees where the telescoping helmet could fold out. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Murphy was tall and muscular, though lanky as a <em>stellah steh</em>, with pale red hair, gray-green eyes, a criss-cross scar on her left cheek, and pale skin that almost seemed to glow bright red whenever she got emotional—which was often. Kim was short and muscular. He reminded Chaeyoung of her own father. Angular face, sharp jawline, clearly muscular but with plump cheeks. He had dark brown eyes, was more tan than Chaeyoung, and had a military style haircut that was on the longer side of the spectrum.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“We need to talk.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Good to see you too, Murphy.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“I am glad you’re doing better, Little Bird. Really, I am. Part of why we cajoled you into the medical evac.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Really?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Murphy nodded. “Yes, really, getting Anya here was not our main objective…but talking about that is not why we’re here.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Why are you here?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“We know what they’re offering you, Little Bird,” Murphy sat in the chair next to Chaeyoung’s medical flat, pulled up close, clasped her hands, leaned in and whispered. “We’re here to give you some more options.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Why? What options?” Chaeyoung scowled at Murphy, then at Kim.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Do you know what they’re going to do to Copper Wing?” Murphy sounded worried.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“I assume, help her recover?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“No,” Murphy was glaring sternly at Chaeyoung. “They’re going to take her to Sol, and they’re going to dissect her—they’re going to pull her apart.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“<em>Nawa oh</em>, no way,” Chaeyoung scoffed. “They’re <em>pol hookoochoh</em>, but there’s no way they’d do that to one of their own.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“That’s just it,” Murphy sighed. “There’s a lot of dark matter in the universe, Little Bird, and it makes the stars move. You’ve only seen a fraction of it—we live in it.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“What’s that supposed to mean?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“This was the last meter of a fight we’ve had with Grayson Services Group for more than a year.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Who’s we?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Our unit,” Kim said from the doorway, acting as a look-out.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Yes. The Shades who follow Copper Wing have been the spearhead of this fight, but we’ve earned a lot of powerful political enemies. This diplomatic team? Do you think it just showed up at the exact right moment to pick us up and take us to Ya Ke?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“No, I guess that doesn’t make sense.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“USV <em>Neva Palava</em> and its diplomats were stationed in Gamov. Proper time to <em>gidizip </em>from Gamov to Sipapu is seventy-six days, so they had to leave before you even were on the ice of Tritonis Prime.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Look,” Chaeyoung made no effort to hide the irritation in her voice. “I know how <em>gidizip</em> works, so what’s your point?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“They came here because of all the pipes we hit before we even got your distress call. Shades,” Murphy gestured to herself and Kim. “We operate in the gray. We have official positions in the United Planets Navy, but we’re attached to cut-out civilian entities registered on IBIS—which means if we get caught in a big enough way, we’re entirely on our own and expendable.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“And that implies what?” Chaeyoung shook her head. “That they’ll just kill one of their own? Because she’s expendable and has a lot of enemies?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Yes,” Murphy said. “They came here to court martial her. It doesn’t matter how many lives she saved, how many Grayson operations we stopped, all that matters is that diplomats had to be called out to smooth over the fallout from a Naval unit that shouldn’t exist, and they need someone to pin the blame on. But, because of what went down on Tritonis Prime, they’re going to take her to some secret Naval research facility—probably Sedna—and they’re going to study her like she’s some kind of artifact. They’ll keep her there for the rest of her life, short or long.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>There was a lump in Chaeyoung’s throat. She gulped. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Why did we bring her here, then?” she asked.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“We took a risk to save her and your life.” </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“I wasn’t that bad off.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Little Bird, you were,” Murphy sighed and shook her head. “Bottom-line is this: we’re going to get out of here, take her with us, and go off grid.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Fuck me,” Chaeyoung’s eyes went wide. “You’ll really risk everything to do that for her?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Yes,” Murphy said with no hesitation. “And we’d do it for you, too.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Kim joined them and gave her a resolute nod. “Without a doubt. We’d do the same for either of you.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“What’s my role in this…why tell me all this?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Murphy leaned back. “Look, Little Bird. We know where they were taking Vis. It was one of our safe houses. We have our Shades working there. They know and trust, Copper Wing. You should come with us. We can get you back to Vis, and you don’t have to take any of their<em> </em>deals.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Chaeyoung ran a finger along her old scar, felt the apprehension of the decision in her jaw and muscles. “That’s… a lot to process.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Murphy closed her fist, tapped it gently on her shoulder. “You don’t need to decide now. We have a plan, and we’re going to see it through with or without you. We thought you deserved to know before we do anything. Little Bird, you’ve more than earned that choice.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>***</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Chaeyoung knew she was running out of time as she walked the halls of <em>Neva Palava </em>freely. She still felt heavy and slow in the gentle three-quarters standard gravity of the spin deck, but she could walk unaided, finally, and could roam freely during the <em>gidizip </em>to Ya Ke. Now that <em>Neva Palava </em>had arrived in Ya Ke, the deadline to decide loomed over her like a dark cloud. She had hours left before <em>Neva Palava </em>would burn away their interstellar delta-vee, and she had to decide her future.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body><em>Neva Palava’s </em>spin deck was long, with a gently sloping horizon that produced a strange visual effect like she was perpetually walking up a hill. Though the hall was, apparently, simply an interstitial space between large <em>celarium</em> suites and the smaller crew quarters where she now had a bunk. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>A scent of fresh flowers wafted from the large green spaces of the <em>celarium </em>hatches. Then she noticed the occasional crushed flower petal or dirty boot print—left before an autonomous system could clean up the mess.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Cooperative Defense of the Spanning Worlds and United Planets Marines stationed guards outside the <em>celarium</em> suites. This discouraged her from entering any of the suites, even though large portions of the green space were public space on <em>Neva Palava</em>.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Each time the bottom of armored boots appeared on the long horizon, up atop the curved hill she was circling, she would tense up. She would stuff her hands into pockets in the outer layer of her biosuit, remember the ticking deadline, hurry her walking pace as she inspected the elaborate Titanian trellis sprawled throughout the halls, on the hatchways, on the chairs, the floors, and the ceiling. The unsaturated colors of the etchings along the wall brought to mind the dark hues of Titan’s haze.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>After a few circuits through the spin deck, Chaeyoung’s face was warm and her forehead was sweaty, so she ducked into one of the few unguarded recreational areas. This rec room was maybe half the size of the voluminous <em>celarium</em> suite, and was a mixture of exercise space, lounge, mess, and bar. The bar and lounge area were lit in low orange and blue lights, while the vibrational isolation platforms with exercise equipment were in a harsh, but bright, white. The walls had dark blue grays with flecks of Titanian hues painted on them. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Compared to the hallway, the bar and lounge area was moody. Most importantly, it was completely empty at present, save the service autos. She went directly to the bar, sat down, and waved over an autonomous tender.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>A simple ceramic cylinder on a track whirred over, a light blinked, and the fluctuating voice asked her. “What can I get for you, <em>ohlowyeh</em>?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“<em>Soja</em>.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“We have many types of <em>soja</em>—perhaps there is a type you are fond of, <em>ohlowyeh</em>?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“<em>Nocha soja</em>?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Ah, of course, <em>ohlowyeh</em>. We have several <em>nocha soja</em> flavors. <em>Coleta de Dados </em>2348, Tombaugh <em>deul ten chalk nyan</em>, <em>Di Sousa</em> <em>Key Sa</em>, <em>Di Sousa ten chalk deul nyan</em>—”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“I’ll take a shot of each of those four.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Of course, <em>ohlowyeh</em>.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Arms appeared, and the auto-tender poured<em> soja </em>into large glasses. Her overindulgence was served. She pulled herself onto a stool, worked her elbows into the tabletop, and quickly downed a glass of <em>nocha soja</em>. Fermented ginsenosides created a sensation very similar to carbonation, but not identical. She smiled as the astringent tingle in her mouth—the rich, aged flavors—stirred pleasant memories. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>There was a gentle <em>click</em> as the hatch nearest the bar opened. There was a lump in her throat, and she took a long pull on the <em>nocha soja</em>. <em>Click click click</em>, boots gently approached her.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Little Bird, we need to talk,” Murphy said.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“I still haven’t made my decision.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Does this mean anything to you?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>A vantablack lizard glove slid an ink display over the bar top. Chaeyoung threw her head back, finishing the rest of the <em>soja </em>in her cup, and set it next to the ink display. She reached for another glass but froze. On the ink display it said, simply. “Remember <em>Di Polyeznaya, eheen?</em>”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Where did you get this?” </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Two vantablack lizard Shades caught Chaeyoung by surprise when she turned around. Fully equipped with foil over their coilguns, gray mottled covers over their backs, and large rucksacks. The pair looked ready for combat. She gulped.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“We checked one of the safe house dead drops. Found this along with a link to a public message system,” Murphy explained, her voice only lightly distorted through the speaker systems on the exterior of her Shade.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“It’s from Vis.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“You’re certain?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Absolutely.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Are you with us, Little Bird?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Chaeyoung grabbed another cup of <em>soja</em>, took a swig. “Ah! <em>Ye</em>…I’m with you. What now?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Are you certain? There’s no turning back from this decision.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>She took a deep breath. Her lips quivered. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“<em>Ye</em>. I’m in. All the way.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Hold still,” Murphy said. “Going to send your picture, hash it, and drop it on the public message system. Let them know we’re coming—if your <em>eheen </em>is with who I think she is we’ll get a code-word response.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Chaeyoung rested her arm on the bar stool, her body getting rigid and posing for a photo out of instinct.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“<em>Oke</em> and sent.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“What now?”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Light lag means we have at least fourteen minutes before we hear back but,” Murphy handed Chaeyoung a familiar AlKapThil-like poncho. “We go dark, we get Anya out of the brig, we get to the nearest Titan flyer, we get our <em>yansh </em>out of here.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Chaeyoung began pulling the poncho over her biosuit, strapping the power block to her wrist. “<em>Fen dan</em>, I hope this works.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Button up,” Murphy said as she stood back.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Chaeyoung hallucinated as the Shades became flickering gray and black shapes. She thought she saw an axolotl-type bipedal auto, then a flock of gray birds, and finally crumpling ink displays before Murphy and Kim entirely disappeared from her sight. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>A vague impression of a shimmer was all that remained. Something connected to her EAR, and orange translucent silhouettes of Murphy and Kim appeared. She looked down at her own metaflage poncho, snapped closed her telescoping spinel ceramic helmet, pulled the hood over her faceplate, and became a ghost herself.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Stick to my back, Little Bird,” Murphy said. “Keep your faceplate behind me. Radio silent until we’re off <em>Neva Palava</em>.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“Got it.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>Chaeyoung grabbed onto one of Murphy’s shoulders, hunched over, and followed the pair of Shades out into the hallway. It took half a minute to walk along the spin deck and get to the elevators. They walked silently, invisibly, past guards at the <em>celarium </em>suites, service autos checking various systems in the ceiling, and guards posted at the elevator to the non-spin sections. </body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>She bit down on her lip, swallowed the questions she had. The group entered an elevator, rode it to the microgravity sections of <em>Neva Palava</em>, and then floated through into a cargo bay where a Titan flyer was waiting.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>She was light-headed, nauseated, and drunk by the time they arrived. She wanted to talk but had to keep reminding herself not to—keep quiet, keep low, follow Murphy. The ramp to the Titan flyer’s passenger compartment opened. Murphy went ahead, pulling Chaeyoung in her wake.</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>“<em>Oke, </em>Little Bird. Settle into a flat and wait for us. Pull that hood down over your faceplate. We’ll be back soon.”</body></html></p><p><html><head></head><body>She strapped herself into one of the vertical flats, pulled the hood over her faceplate, and settled in.
